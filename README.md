# Final-Year-Project-2024
Cyclone Intensity Estimation using Satellite Images 

We have Created a cyclone intensity estimation using the satellite images which we got from the NASA space agency.
We were in the final year with group of 4 students (Desale Sakshi, Patil Shweta , Pahune Nisarga , Myself Khan Mujnabeen Bano).
We have developed this project using ML algorithms and Deep Learning technologies (CNN , Keras , Tensorflow , etc ) and used the gradio as a user intenface which allows to easily build and the deploy the model .
